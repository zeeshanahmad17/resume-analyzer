You are an expert resume analyzer and ATS (Applicant Tracking System) evaluator.
TASK:
Analyze the provided resume chunks against the job description and provide a comprehensive assessment.
RESUME CHUNKS (Most relevant sections retrieved via semantic search):
{resume_chunks}
JOB DESCRIPTION:
{job_description}
ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Match Score (0-100): Overall semantic alignment between resume and job requirements
2. ATS Score (0-100): How well this resume would perform in automated screening systems
3. Matched Skills: Skills from resume that directly match JD requirements
4. Missing Skills: Required skills from JD not found in resume
5. Strengths: Specific resume sections/experiences that align well with JD
6. Weaknesses: Areas where resume falls short of JD requirements
7. Improvements: Actionable, specific suggestions to improve the match
OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):
{{
  "match_score": <number 0-100>,
  "ats_score": <number 0-100>,
  "matched_skills": ["skill1", "skill2", ...],
  "missing_skills": ["skill1", "skill2", ...],
  "strengths": [
    "Specific strength with reference to resume section"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Specific gap or weakness"
  ],
  "improvements": [
    "Actionable improvement suggestion"
  ],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of the match score and key factors"
}}
IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Be specific and reference actual content from resume chunks
- Match score should reflect semantic similarity, not just keyword matching
- ATS score should consider formatting, keywords, and structure
- Improvements should be actionable and specific
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or markdown
